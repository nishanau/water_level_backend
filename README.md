# Water Tank Monitoring System - Backend API

This is the backend API for the Water Tank Monitoring System, built with NestJS and MongoDB. The system allows users to monitor their water tank levels, place orders for water delivery, and receive notifications.

## Features

- **User Authentication** - Register, login, and token-based authentication
- **Water Tank Management** - Register tanks, track water levels, and configure settings
- **Order Processing** - Place, track, and manage water delivery orders
- **Supplier Management** - Suppliers can view and update order status
- **Real-time Water Level Monitoring** - IoT integration for real-time water level updates
- **Notifications** - Receive alerts for low water levels, order status changes, and more
- **Role-Based Access Control** - Different permissions for customers, suppliers, and admins

## Architecture

The backend is built using a modular architecture with the following components:

- **NestJS Framework** - A TypeScript-based Node.js framework
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL database for flexible data storage
- **JWT Authentication** - Secure token-based authentication
- **Mongoose ODM** - Object Document Mapper for MongoDB
- **Validation** - Request validation using class-validator
- **Dependency Injection** - NestJS built-in DI container
